# Item Based Recommender System
 - General Familiarization with data.
 - Mathematical foundations of, and simple examples of recommender systems.
 - Execution of methods on data.
 - Short introduction to Surprise package.

## Activities include:

Manipulating DataFrames
Visualizing data
Calculating distance in multiple ways
Calculating and interpreting similarity scores
Using numpy's SVD function
Learning about the Surprise package
Motivation: Recommender systems provide non-parametric comparisons between items. They are foundational in how individuals are served and thus navigate the web.

## Objectives:

- Understand mathematical foundations of recommender systems.
- Translation of mathematical algorithm into code.
