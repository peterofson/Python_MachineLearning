### In coding Ridge Regression you will be asked to:

Mean center target variable and mean center / standardize observation
Calculate Ridge Regression weights using linear algebra
Create a hyperparameter tuning process
Motivation: Ridge Regression offers a way to mitigate some of the weaknesses of Least Squares Linear Regression to build more robust models.

Objectives: This assignmet will -

Test Python competency and mathematical understandings of Ridge Regression
Begin to introduce the concept of hyper-parameter tuning
Problem: Using housing data, we will attempt to predict house price using living area with a regression model.

Data: Data comes from Kaggle's House Prices Dataset.

See above link for Description of data.
