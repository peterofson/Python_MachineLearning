# This assignment will work through the definition of a Logistic Regression function in Python. After a summary of the equations that will be used, and a brief EDA of the "Titanic" data we will be using, you will be asked to define a number of functions which will, in sum, create a Logistic Regression.
A demonstration of sklearn's implementation of Logistic Regression will close the assignment.

You will be asked to code functions to do the following:

Implement the Logistic Regression Algorithm
Calculate the value of the sigmoid function
Calculate the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to  ww 
Sum the gradients of the log-likelihood with respect to  ww 
Execute logistic regression, stopping after a particular iteration
Determine convergence of the logistic regression algorithm
