### K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Project:

Part 1: Familiarize yourself with the problem and data
Part 2: Code a KNN Classifier from scratch, evaluate performance, and compare to Scikit-Learn's implementation
Part 3: Interpret results and explain findings.
This will include:

Answering simple questions regarding the data
Manipulating multiple DataFrames
Coding functions to:
Calculate Euclidean distance
Calculate distance between many pairs of points
Implement a majority voting system
Combine the above to create a custom KNN algorithm
Use KNeighborsClassifier in sklearn
Motivation: KNN is a reasonably simple algorithm that is easy to grasp and can be very effective.

Objectives: By the end of this assignment, you will:

Have a firm understanding of the KNN algorithm
Have practiced running through the data science workflow to solve a problem
Will demonstate how to translate a mathematical algorithm into effective code
Understand common pitfalls when working with distances
Problem: Classify the type of activity a person is performing based on measurements collected from a smartphone. The activities include:

Walking
Walking_Upstairs
Walking_Downstairs
Sitting
Standing
Laying
